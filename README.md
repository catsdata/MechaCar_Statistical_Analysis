## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

write a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 1 by completing all requirements below:

- The MechaCar_mpg.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
- An RScript is written for a linear regression model to be performed on all six variables (10 pt)
- An RScript is written to create the statistical summary of the linear regression model with the intended p-values (10 pt)
- There is a summary that addresses all three questions (5 pt)

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

You will earn a perfect score for Deliverable 2 by completing all requirements below:

- The Suspension_Coil.csv file is imported and read into a dataframe (5 pt)
- An RScript is written to create a total summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of the PSI for all manufacturing lots (10 pt)
- An RScript is written to create a lot summary dataframe that has the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for each manufacturing lot (10 pt)
- There is a summary that addresses the design specification requirement for all the manufacturing lots and each lot individually (5 pt)
